# F Sharp Comments â€“ Infininight 2008-03-21

* Just name the entire block comment.block.empty, once the punctuation scopes are added you can easily tell your location by adding the punctuation scope. (comment.block.empty punctuation.definition.comment.end)
* keyword.other.function-definition should be storage.type.function
* In string.quoted.double the look ahead in the begin seems to be a mistake, as stated it serves no purpose.
* In punctuation.separator.string.ignore-eol there is an unescaped $ with items after it, there can never be items after a $.
* invalid.illeagal.character.string misspelled.
* entity.name.binding should be entity.name.type.binding
* A few punctuation scopes are missing, if you want me to add them for you note me.
